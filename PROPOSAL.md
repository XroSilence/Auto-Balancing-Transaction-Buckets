# Auto-Balancing Transaction Buckets: A Novel MEV Prevention Architecture

## Abstract

We propose a novel blockchain transaction processing architecture that eliminates Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) through economic uniformity rather than cryptographic privacy. By grouping transactions into auto-balancing buckets with identical economic signatures, the system makes MEV extraction architecturally unprofitable while maintaining transparency and composability.

## Problem Statement

Current blockchain architectures suffer from systemic MEV extraction that acts as a hidden tax on users:

- **Frontrunning**: Bots scan mempools and execute trades ahead of users
- **Sandwich attacks**: Transactions are surrounded by manipulative trades
- **Liquidation frontrunning**: Leveraged positions are targeted for extraction
- **Cross-exchange arbitrage**: Price differences are exploited faster than users can react

These issues stem from the transparency of pending transactions combined with the ability to pay higher gas fees for priority execution.

## Proposed Solution: Auto-Balancing Transaction Buckets

### Core Mechanism

**Fixed Interval Processing**: Every 12 seconds, the system:
1. Collects all pending transactions
2. Calculates total gas requirements
3. Distributes transactions into perfectly balanced buckets
4. Processes all buckets simultaneously

**Economic Uniformity**: All buckets within each interval have identical total gas costs, making them indistinguishable to MEV extractors.

### Algorithm Specification

```
EVERY 12 SECONDS:
  pending_transactions = collect_pending()
  total_gas = sum(tx.gas_limit * tx.gas_price for tx in pending_transactions)
  
  IF total_gas <= MAX_BUCKET_SIZE:
    buckets = create_balanced_buckets(2, pending_transactions)
  ELSE:
    bucket_count = ceil(total_gas / MAX_BUCKET_SIZE)
    buckets = create_balanced_buckets(bucket_count, pending_transactions)
  
  FOR bucket IN buckets:
    assert bucket.total_gas == buckets[0].total_gas  // Uniformity check
    process_bucket(bucket)
```

### Gas Fee Distribution

**Pre-Authorization Model**: 
- Users pre-authorize maximum potential gas fees
- Actual fees are calculated post-settlement based on bucket weight
- Unused authorization is refunded

**Proportional Charging**:
```
user_fee = (user_gas_used / bucket_total_gas) * bucket_total_cost
```

## Technical Implementation

### Bucket Balancing Algorithm

**Transaction Distribution**:
- Large transactions are split across multiple buckets
- Small transactions are grouped to achieve balance
- Each bucket maintains identical total gas costs

**Price Discovery**:
- Settlement prices determined across all buckets simultaneously
- Eliminates inter-bucket arbitrage opportunities
- Creates true batch auction pricing

### System Properties

**MEV Resistance**: 
- No profitable bucket selection criteria
- No temporal ordering advantages
- No information leakage before settlement

**Scalability**:
- Bucket count adjusts dynamically based on demand
- Fixed 12-second settlement guarantees
- Linear scaling with transaction volume

**Composability**:
- Maintains DeFi composability unlike privacy-focused solutions
- Transparent settlement process
- Standard transaction formats

## Economic Analysis

### MEV Elimination Mechanism

Traditional MEV relies on:
1. **Selection**: Choosing profitable transactions to target
2. **Ordering**: Positioning trades relative to target transactions
3. **Information**: Knowing transaction details before execution

Our system eliminates all three:
1. **No Selection**: All buckets appear economically identical
2. **No Ordering**: Simultaneous bucket processing
3. **No Information**: Transaction details hidden until settlement

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates MEV taxation (estimated 2-5% of transaction value)
- Reduces gas costs through batching
- Predictable settlement times
- Fair market access for all participants

**Costs**:
- 12-second maximum settlement delay
- Pre-authorization capital requirements
- Additional computational overhead for bucket balancing

## Comparison to Existing Solutions

| Solution | MEV Protection | Composability | Adoption Barrier |
|----------|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| Privacy Coins | High | Low | High |
| Private Mempools | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Commit-Reveal | Medium | Medium | High |
| **Auto-Balancing Buckets** | **High** | **High** | **Low** |

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept
- Develop bucket balancing algorithms
- Create economic simulation models
- Test on development networks

### Phase 2: Testnet Deployment
- Deploy on Ethereum testnets
- Optimize bucket size parameters
- Community testing and feedback

### Phase 3: Mainnet Integration
- Layer 2 implementation (Arbitrum, Optimism)
- Cross-chain compatibility
- Integration with existing DEX protocols

## Security Considerations

**Attack Vectors**:
- Bucket stuffing attacks (mitigated by max bucket sizes)
- Timing manipulation (prevented by fixed intervals)
- Cross-bucket correlation (eliminated by uniform distribution)

**Defensive Measures**:
- Dynamic bucket size adjustment
- Transaction mixing algorithms
- Economic disincentives for gaming attempts

## Conclusion

Auto-balancing transaction buckets represent a paradigm shift from hiding transaction intent to making exploitation economically impossible. By creating deterministic fairness through mathematical uniformity, this approach could serve as foundational infrastructure for equitable DeFi systems.

Unlike privacy-focused solutions that sacrifice composability or adoption, this system maintains blockchain transparency while eliminating the MEV extraction layer that currently taxes all users.
