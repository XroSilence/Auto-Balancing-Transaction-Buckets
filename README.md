# Auto-Balancing Transaction Buckets

Been thinking about the MEV problem for a while. Most solutions either break DeFi composability or require everyone to opt-in. This approach works automatically through economic uniformity rather than cryptographic privacy.

**[Full technical writeup here](PROPOSAL.md)**

## What's Different
- No privacy coins or mixing required
- Works with existing DeFi protocols  
- Makes MEV extraction unprofitable through math, not hiding

Still working through some edge cases, but the core concept seems solid. I do some web development (HTML/JS/TypeScript), but blockchain and crypto implementation is completely outside my wheelhouse. Happy to contribute more conceptual ideas if anyone wants to discuss the approach, but would need to hand this off to someone with actual crypto development experience to make it real.
